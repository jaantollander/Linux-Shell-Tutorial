# Implement Bubble and David Shell sort algorithms using BASH
# internal functionality only. Make a performance comparison
# for sorting 1000 random numbers with 'time' utility.
#
# (Shellsort http://lcm.csa.iisc.ernet.in/dsa/node197.html)
#
# For generating random numbers one can use function we have
# developed during the tutorial. Alternatively, script can
# accept random numbers as standard input, generated like
# 'shuf -i1-1000 -n1000' or in a similar way.
#
# Optionally, if only Bubble sort algorithm is implemented,
# it is 4 points.
